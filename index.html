        <h3>FOR the Proposition</h3>

        <figure>
          <img src="plottwo.png" alt="Plot for proposition" width="600">
          <figcaption>Despite some substantiated cases, the majority of NYPD complaints (76.5%) from 2006 to 2015 were dismissed as unsubstantiated or exonerated, showing that most complaints do not result in disciplinary action.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Design Decisions and Rationale:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Bar Chart Type (2):
 I used a bar chart to compare complaint outcomes because it's a direct and effective way to highlight differences between categories. The chart makes the stark disparity between substantiated and unsubstantiated/exonerated outcomes—76.5% vs. 23.5%—visually immediate. This choice doesn’t distort the data or rely on unnecessary embellishment. It communicates the point clearly by leaning into what bar charts do best which is showing categorical contrast.
</li>
          <li>Title Framing (–1):
 The title, “Most Police Complaints Lead to No Disciplinary Action,” supports the argument by foregrounding the most striking aspect of the data. It focuses attention on the majority outcome and creates a sense of conclusion. That framing steers interpretation toward a critical view of complaint outcomes, which adds persuasive weight. The language isn’t neutral as it simplifies the result and omits detail about what “no action” actually means. This use of emphasis allows me to drive the message.</li>
          <li> Grouping Categories (–1.5):
I grouped “Unsubstantiated” and “Exonerated” together under “No Action” to streamline the comparison. This made the visual simpler and more forceful, but it also blurred an important distinction. By combining the two, the chart strengthens the claim that disciplinary outcomes are rare, but it compresses nuance in a way that advances the argument. The simplification benefits the narrative more than the viewer’s understanding of the full context.
</li>
            <li>Percentage Labels (2):
 I labeled each bar with its percentage to make the scale of the disparity unmistakable. This reinforces the message while staying completely transparent. The numbers are accurate, clearly visible, and easy to compare. The labeling supports the story without hiding anything which sharpens the viewer’s understanding and strengthens the visual's integrity.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>

        <figure>
          <img src="plotone.png" alt="Plot agaisnt proposition" width="600">
          <figcaption>Substantiated NYPD complaints steadily increased from 2006 to 2015, with over 4,343 cases leading to accountability, indicating a rise in confirmed misconduct over time.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Design Decisions and Rationale:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Line and Area Chart (2):
 I used a line chart with an area fill to show substantiated complaints over time because this is the most appropriate format for displaying trends. The rising line represents a real increase, and the shaded area helps underscore the volume without distorting scale or shape. The design is clean and standard, and it supports the narrative of increasing accountability while keeping the data intact.</li>
          <li>Title Framing (–1):
 The title, “Accountability in Action,” presents the trend as a success story. It links the increase in substantiated complaints directly to improved accountability, which is an optimistic reading. This kind of framing signals how the chart should be interpreted before the viewer even sees the data. The title helps push a positive and encourage interpretation, but it doesn’t misstate the facts.
</li>
          <li>
Timeframe Selection (–2):
 Ending the chart in 2015 is a selective cutoff that helps preserve the upward trend. Complaints declined after that year, but by excluding the drop, the chart locks in a positive trajectory and avoids showing reversal. This is a time-cutting tactic that I used on the x axis to stop before the data starts contradicting the story. While the 2006–2015 range does reflect real growth, omitting the years after distorts the overall picture and turns what should be a peak into a misleading endpoint.</li>
          <li>Selective Focus on Substantiated Complaints (–1.5):
 The chart shows only substantiated complaints and leaves out the unsubstantiated ones entirely. This omission is significant because substantiated cases represent a small fraction of total complaints. By highlighting only the confirmed cases, the chart builds a narrative of increasing accountability while hiding the broader context which is that most complaints don’t lead to discipline. This selective framing creates an impression of progress that’s technically accurate but deeply incomplete. It shifts the viewer’s focus away from the low substantiation rate and onto a carefully framed success story.</li>
